### About me 👋

As a curious and proactive junior software engineer, I am driven by a passion for continuous improvement. With a background in pensions and starting at a fast paced start-up, I continued to grow rapidly with the company over the next 5 years. I have honed my communication skills through daily interactions with high net worth clients, various professionals and colleagues I managed.

I highly value agile methodologies for their ability to deliver high-quality software efficiently. Proficient in OOP, TDD, paired programming, and agile practices, I am eager to apply my skills and curiosity to a role where I can write impactful code for meaningful programs.

With a strong work ethic, excellent problem-solving abilities, and a natural inclination for learning, I am confident in my ability to contribute value to any team. I am excited about the prospect of joining a dynamic and forward-thinking team, where I can make a positive impact and continue to grow as a developer.
